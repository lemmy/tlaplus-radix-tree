# TLA+ Specifications for Radix Trees

This repository includes TLA+ specifications and models for
[Radix trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) and algorithms
on Radix trees. The focus of this repository is specifically on specifying
the behavior of the  [hashicorp/go-immutable-radix](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-immutable-radix)
Go library. However, many modules are fairly generic and could easily be
adapted to any Radix implementation.

I'll add usage instructions and a Makefile for command-line operations later.
For now, it is expected you use TLA+ Toolbox and you know how to import these.
